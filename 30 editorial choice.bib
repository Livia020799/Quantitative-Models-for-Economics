	abstract = {In recent years, the field of combinatorial optimization has witnessed a true tsunami of "novel" metaheuristic methods, most of them based on a metaphor of some natural or man-made process. The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together - it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics. © 2013 The Authors.},

The liner shipping problem is a multi-trip vehicle routing problem, and consists of deciding weekly routes for the selected ships. A solution method consisting of three phases is presented. In phase 1, all feasible single routes are generated for the largest ship available. Some of these routes will use only a small portion of the ship's capacity and can be performed by smaller ships at less cost. This fact is used when calculating the cost of each route. In phase 2, the single routes generated in phase 1 are combined into multiple routes. By solving a set partitioning problem (phase 3), where the columns are the routes generated in phases 1 and 2, we find both the optimal fleet and the coherent routes for the fleet. © 1999 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Efficiency can be measured in, for example, lower cost or more flexibility. An important aspect of the collaboration is to decide on how to share the benefits-for example, cost, profit, or resources. There are many sharing mechanisms or cost allocations proposed in the literature. Some are based on simple proportional rules and others are based on theoretical concepts found in game theory. We provide a survey on cost allocation methods found in the literature on collaborative transportation, including problems on planning, vehicle routing, traveling salesman, distribution, and inventory. A total of 55 scientific articles compose the main part of the survey, most of them published between 2010 and 2015. We identify more than 40 cost allocation methods used in this stream of literature. We describe the theoretical basis for the main methods as well as the cases where they are used. We also report savings from the collaborations when they are based on industrial data. Some directions for future research are discussed. © 2016 The Authors.},

The work presented in the literature has focused mainly on either reducing the number of iterations of the algorithm or on restricting the solution space of the decomposed problems.

This strategy, referred to as covering cut bundle (CCB) generation, is shown to implement in a novel way the multiple constraints generation idea. The CCB generation is applied to mixed integer problems arising from two types of applications: the scheduling of crude oil and the scheduling problem for multi-product, multi-purpose batch plants. In both cases, CCB significantly decreases the number of iterations of the Benders method, leading to improved resolution times. © 2009 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.},

Thus, new experiments with MTP have been performed on instances from more challenging problem classes: Our results confirm the general opinion that MTP represents the state-or-the-art for exact solution methods for the BPP, even though the size of the problems, which can be solved to a proven optimum in reasonable computing time, still appears to be unsatisfactory. © 1997 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of some of the recent developments in the assessment of network vulnerability and robustness through appropriate tools that assist in the quantification of network efficiency/performance and the identification of the importance of network components, such as nodes and links. We demonstrated how rigorously constructed and well-defined network measures can capture not only the network topology underlying a particular critical system, but also the underlying behavior of decision-makers, the resulting flows, and induced costs in the reality of demands for resources, whether fixed or elastic (price-dependent). In addition, we reviewed how to determine the synergy associated with network integration, with a focus on supply chains, as may occur not only in corporate applications, such as in mergers and acquisitions, but also in humanitarian ones, as in the case of the creation of teams and partnerships for humanitarian logistics. We illustrated the concepts and tools in this paper, which are based on numerous publications, through a spectrum of applications and numerical examples. Because the number of disasters is growing globally, it is imperative to have transparent, well-understood, and appropriate tools for the determination of network vulnerability and robustness, as critical infrastructure networks from transportation, telecommunications, supply chains, to financial and electric power ones, provide the ties that bind our economies and societies together. Local disruptions can have global impacts. Only when network components are identified as to their importance and rankings can decision-makers and policy analysts, as well as planners and engineers, understand in an objective way which components should be maintained and protected the most, with implications for disaster and emergency preparedness as well as national security. © 2010 The Authors.

Successful real-world cases, however, are rare since horizontal cooperation in logistics is not usually sustainable. This paper pays attention to this paradox of the lack of cases and discusses 16 identified practical issues that could explain this phenomenon. We propose a taxonomy composed of four categories categorizing the practical issues according to a value chain approach: design, planning and operations, market/business, and behaviors. Furthermore, we propose and discuss some measures to mitigate these problems.                          © 2018 The Authors.

We consider a problem that occurs in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a transportation system for supplying disaster victims with relief goods must be established. We propose bi-objective optimization models with a monetary objective and humanitarian objective. Uncertainty in the accessibility of the road network is modeled by a discrete set of scenarios. The key features of our model are the determination of locations for intermediate depots and acquisition of vehicles. Several model variants are considered. First, the operating budget can be fixed at the first stage for all possible scenarios or determined for each scenario at the second stage. Second, the assignment of vehicles to a depot can be either fixed or free. Third, we compare a heterogeneous vehicle fleet to a homogeneous fleet. We study the impact of the variants on the solutions. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions is computed by applying the adaptive Epsilon-constraint method.

To help the retailer get a bank loan at a lower interest rate, the supplier provides guarantee for the retailer's loan up to a prespecified amount. In a Stackelberg game, the supplier decides the wholesale price and the guarantee amount as a leader, and then the retailer determines the order quantity and the amount of the loan as a follower. The supplier is risk-neutral while the retailer's risk preference is reflected by a spectral risk measure (risk-neutral, risk-averse, or risk-seeking). For a given wholesale price and guarantee amount, the retailer's objective function is quasi-concave in the order quantity. The optimal solutions for the supplier and the retailer are derived. The supplier's expected profit with optimized wholesale price increases with the guarantee amount, and thus the supplier's optimal policy is to provide a full guarantee for the retailer's loan. When the supplier can limit his guarantee responsibility by a proportion of the outstanding loan obligation, the supplier's optimal policy is also to provide a full guarantee. Even if the retailer incurs bankruptcy costs in the event of repayment default, the supplier's optimal guarantee policy remains the same in these two different forms of limited guarantee. However, when the wholesale price is exogenous, that is, not a decision variable, the full guarantee is not necessarily optimal for supplier. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study investigates a co-opetition-type dual-channel supply chain that consists of a competitive supplier (CS) and a capital-constrained manufacturer (CCM). The CCM procures key components from and simultaneously competes with the CS in the consumer market. To address the CCM's capital constraint, we consider three financing strategies, namely, trade credit, bank loan, and hybrid financing (i.e., combined use of bank loan and equity financing). Game models are established to characterize the interactions between the CS and CCM. The corresponding equilibria are derived under each strategy. Then, comparative analyses are conducted, and the CS's and CCM's preference structures regarding the three strategies are revealed. On this basis, the equilibrium strategy can be concluded as either trade credit or hybrid financing, but never bank loan. Specifically, when the equity financing ratio is small or large, trade credit is an equilibrium strategy. When the equity financing ratio is medium, the equilibrium strategy between trade credit and hybrid financing is determined by consumers’ product preference and loan interest rate. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {The optimization of an economic indicator has traditionally been the sole objective function of mathematical programming models for power generation expansion planning. Recently, however, other evaluation aspects, such as environmental concerns, were also given an explicit role as objective functions in mathematical models. Models become thus more realistic so that decision makers are able to grasp the inherent conflicts and trade-offs among the distinct objectives in selecting a best compromise plan. A significant change in the planning processes has also occurred concerning new planning methodologies integrating demand-side management (DSM) techniques, in an attempt to change the levels and forms of electricity use by the consumers. This paper presents a multiple objective linear programming model for power generation expansion planning incorporating DSM. The objective functions are the total expansion cost, the environmental impact associated with the installed power capacity and the environmental impact associated with the energy output. DSM is included by modelling it as a new generating group along with the generating alternatives from the supply side. Five categories of constraints are considered related to the reliability of the supply system, the availability of the generating units, the capacity of the DSM-equivalent generating group, the total capacity installed throughout the planning period, the pollutant emissions. Some results are presented derived by using an interactive method, aimed at assisting decision makers in a progressive and selective search of good compromise solutions. © 1996 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In their paper “An improved Clarke and Wright savings algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem,” published in ScienceAsia (38, 3, 307–318, 2012), Pichpibul and Kawtummachai developed a simple stochastic extension of the well-known Clarke and Wright savings heuristic for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Notwithstanding the simplicity of the heuristic, which they call the “improved Clarke and Wright savings algorithm” (ICW), the reported results are among the best heuristics ever developed for this problem. Through a careful reimplementation, we demonstrate that the results published in the paper could not have been produced by the ICW heuristic. Studying the reasons how this paper could have passed the peer review process to be published in an ISI-ranked journal, we have to conclude that the necessary conditions for a thorough examination of a typical paper in the field of optimization are generally lacking. We investigate how this can be improved and come to the conclusion that disclosing source code to reviewers should become a prerequisite for publication. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Over the past few years, investigators in Brazil have been uncovering numerous corruption and money laundering schemes at all levels of government and in the country's largest corporations. It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study employs Google trends and data from the web of science to evaluate the popularity, growth, and impacts of visual analytics (VA) as a research field and data science technique. The paper undertakes quantitative analyses and visualization of the temporal trends, from VA's emergence in 2000 to the end of 2019. The trend analysis helps to forecast future growth in the research and practice of VA. The study highlights four outcomes. First, there is a robust direct relationship among the variables, including VA's growth on the Google trends, the scientific literature production (SLP), and usage of the published documents. Second, the SLP's growth pattern highlights VA's popularity as an emerging field with an overall annual increase of 17.4%. The high citation counts of the published scholarship indicate a significant impact and a continuous growth of the VA field. Third, VA contributes to diverse disciplines other than computer science and information systems, from business and economics to engineering, healthcare, biomedical and chemical sciences, and arts and humanities. VA helps researchers and practitioners in multidisciplinary fields analyze multidimensional data, enhance data visualization, knowledge discovery, generating insights, and make informed decisions. On the reverse, other disciplines contribute to propelling VA's popularity through research productivity, usage, and citation impacts. Finally, a trend analysis predicts sustained future growth of VA technology in research and practice to dissect and sensemaking of the increasingly massive and complex data structures, which is now the norm in many fields. © 2021 The Authors.
