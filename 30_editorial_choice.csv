The work presented in the literature has focused mainly on either reducing the number of iterations of the algorithm or on restricting the solution space of the decomposed problems. In this article, a new strategy for Benders algorithm is proposed and applied to two case studies in order to evaluate its efficiency. This strategy, referred to as covering cut bundle (CCB) generation, is shown to implement in a novel way the multiple constraints generation idea. The CCB generation is applied to mixed integer problems arising from two types of applications: the scheduling of crude oil and the scheduling problem for multi-product, multi-purpose batch plants. In both cases, CCB significantly decreases the number of iterations of the Benders method, leading to improved resolution times. © 2009 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","Benders decomposition; Covering cut bundle; Mixed integer programming; Multi-generation of cuts","","","","","","","","Benders J.F., Partitioning procedures for solving mixed-variables programming problems, Numerische Mathematik, 4, pp. 238-252, (1962); Conejo A.J., Castillo E., Minguez R., Garcia-Bertrand R., Decomposition Techniques in Mathematical Programming, 16, (2006); Cote G., Laughton M., Large-scale mixed integer programming, European Journal of Operational Research, 16, pp. 327-333, (1984); Farkas J., Uber die Theorie der einfachen Ungleichungen, Journal of Mathematics, 124, pp. 1-24, (1902); Gabrel V., Knippel A., Minoux M., Exact solution of multicommodity network optimization problems with general step cost functions, Operational Research Letters, 25, pp. 15-23, (1999); Ierapetritou M., Floudas C., Effective continuous-time formulation for short-term scheduling, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 37, 11, pp. 4341-4359, (1998); Magnanti T., Wong R., Accelerating Benders decomposition algorithmic enhancement and model selection criteria, Operational Research, 29, pp. 464-484, (1981); McDaniel D., Devine M., A modified Benders partitioning algorithm for mixed integer programming, Management Science, 24, pp. 312-319, (1977); Minkowski H., Geometri der Zahlen, (1910); Minkowski H., Theorie der Konvexen Korper, Insbesondere Begrundung ihres Oberflachenbegriffs, (1911); Minoux M., Mathematical Programming Theory and Algorithms.

The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together - it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics. © 2013 The Authors.","Combinatorial optimization; Heuristics; Metaheuristics; Optimization","Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristics; High quality; Innovative research; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic methods; Metaheuristic; Optimization","","","","","","","Abidin Z.Z., Ngah U.K., Arshad M.R., Ping O.B., A novel fly optimization algorithm for swarming application, pp. 425-428, (2010); Adenso-Diaz B., Laguna M., Fine-tuning of algorithms using fractional experimental designs and local search, Operations Research, 54, 1, pp. 99-114, (2006); (2010); Atashpaz-Gargari E., Lucas C., Imperialist competitive algorithm: an algorithm for optimization inspired by imperialistic competition, pp. 4661-4667, (2007); Barr R.S., Golden B.L., Kelly J.P., Resende M.G.C., Stewart W.R., Designing and reporting on computational experiments with heuristic methods, Journal of Heuristics, 1, 1, pp. 9-32, (1995); Burke E.K., Curtois T., Hyde M., Kendall G., Ochoa G., Petrovic S., Vazquez-Rodriguez J.A., Towards the decathlon challenge of search heuristics, Workshop on Automated Heuristic Design - In conjunction with the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2009), (2009); Cotta C., Sevaux M., Sorensen K., Adaptive and Multilevel Metaheuristics, (2008); Coy S.P., Golden B.L., Runger G.C., Wasil E.A., Using experimental design to find effective parameter settings for heuristics, Journal of Heuristics, 7, 1, pp. 77-97, (2001); De Corte A., Sorensen K., Optimisation of water distribution network design: a critical review, (2012); Dorigo M., Optimization, learning and natural algorithms, (1992); Duin C., Voss S., The Pilot method: A strategy for heuristic repetition with application to the Steiner problem in graphs, Networks, 34, 3, pp. 181-191, (1999); Dumitrescu I., Stutzle T., Usage of exact algorithms to enhance stochastic local search algorithms, Matheuristics: Hybridizing Metaheuristics and Mathematical Programming, 10, (2009); Geem Z.W., Survival of the fittest algorithm or the novelest algorithm?: The existence reason of the harmony search algorithm, International Journal of Applied Metaheuristic Computing, 1, 4, pp. 76-80, (2010); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G.V., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Glover F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence, Computers and Operations Research, 13, pp. 533-549, (1986); Glover F., Heuristics for integer programming using surrogate constraints, Decision Sciences, 8, 1, pp. 156-166, (1997); Glover F., Laguna M., Tabu Search, (1997); Goldberg D.E., Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning, (1989); Haddad O.B., Afshar A., Marino M.A., Honey-bees mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm: a new heuristic approach for water resources optimization, Water Resources Management, 20, 5, pp. 661-680, (2006); Hedayatzadeh R., Akhavan Salmassi F., Keshtgari M., Akbari R., Ziarati K., Termite colony optimization: a novel approach for optimizing continuous problems, 18th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE), pp. 553-558, (2010); Hooker J.N., Testing heuristics: We have it all wrong, Journal of Heuristics, 1, 1, pp. 33-42, (1995); Karaboga D., An idea based on honey bee swarm for numerical optimization, (2005); Kirkpatrick S., Gelatt C.J., Vecchi M.P., Optimization by simulated annealing, Science, 220, 4598, pp. 671-680, (1983); Kramer O., Self-adaptive Heuristics for Evolutionary Computation, (2008); Krishnanand K.N., Ghose D., Detection of multiple source locations using a glowworm metaphor with applications to collective robotics, Swarm Intelligence Symposium, pp. 84-91, (2005); Laarhoven P.J.M., Aarts E.H.L., Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications, (1987); Lukasik S., Zak S., Firefly algorithm for continuous constrained optimization tasks, Computational Collective Intelligence.

The goal is to minimize the unused volume. This type of problem belongs to the family of multiple bin size bin packing problems (MBSBPP). The approach includes an extensive set of constraints encountered in real-world applications in the three-dimensional case: the stability, the fragility of the items, the weight distribution, and the possibility to rotate the boxes. It also includes the specific situation in which containers are truncated parallelepipeds. This is typical in the field of air transportation. While most papers on cutting and packing problems describe ad hoc procedures, this paper proposes a mixed integer linear program. The validity of this model is tested on small instances. © 2015 The Authors.","Air transport; Linear programming; Loading problems; Packing problems; Weight distribution","Air transportation; Bins; Containers;

The objective of the IRP is the minimization of the sum of inventory and transportation costs. The formulations include known and new mathematical programming formulations. Valid inequalities are also presented. The formulations are tested on a large set of benchmark instances.

In this paper, we have reviewed the methods that have been proposed for the solution of this problem. Furthermore, the various problem instances and data sets are analyzed that have been used in computational experiments for the evaluation of these methods. The most challenging and yet unsolved methods are identified.

Starting from the most classical routing problems, we introduce the split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP). We review a formulation, the main properties and exact and heuristic solution approaches for the SDVRP. Then, we present a general overview of several variants of the SDVRP and of the literature available. © 2011 The Authors.

Efficiency can be measured in, for example, lower cost or more flexibility. An important aspect of the collaboration is to decide on how to share the benefits-for example, cost, profit, or resources. There are many sharing mechanisms or cost allocations proposed in the literature. Some are based on simple proportional rules and others are based on theoretical concepts found in game theory. We provide a survey on cost allocation methods found in the literature on collaborative transportation, including problems on planning, vehicle routing, traveling salesman, distribution, and inventory. A total of 55 scientific articles compose the main part of the survey, most of them published between 2010 and 2015. We identify more than 40 cost allocation methods used in this stream of literature. We describe the theoretical basis for the main methods as well as the cases where they are used. We also report savings from the collaborations when they are based on industrial data. Some directions for future research are discussed. © 2016 The Authors.","Collaborative logistics; Cost allocation; Game theory; Group decisions and negotiations; Transportation","Amphibious vehicles;

The CCM procures key components from and simultaneously competes with the CS in the consumer market. To address the CCM's capital constraint, we consider three financing strategies, namely, trade credit, bank loan, and hybrid financing (i.e., combined use of bank loan and equity financing). Game models are established to characterize the interactions between the CS and CCM. The corresponding equilibria are derived under each strategy. Then, comparative analyses are conducted, and the CS's and CCM's preference structures regarding the three strategies are revealed. On this basis, the equilibrium strategy can be concluded as either trade credit or hybrid financing, but never bank loan. Specifically, when the equity financing ratio is small or large, trade credit is an equilibrium strategy. When the equity financing ratio is medium, the equilibrium strategy between trade credit and hybrid financing is determined by consumers’ product preference and loan interest rate. © 2019 The Authors.

The first part of the paper introduces the classical models for the VCP, and discusses how these models can be used and possibly strengthened to derive exact and heuristic algorithms for the problem. Computational results on the best performing algorithms proposed in the literature are reported. The second part of the paper is devoted to some generalizations of the problem, which are obtained by considering additional constraints [Bandwidth (Multi) Coloring Problem, Bounded Vertex Coloring Problem] or an objective function with a special structure (Weighted Vertex Coloring Problem). The extension of the models for the classical VCP to the considered problems and the best performing algorithms from the literature, as well as the corresponding computational results, are reported. © 2009 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","Algorithms; Bandwidth coloring; Bounded vertex coloring; Computational results; Mathematical formulation; Vertex coloring; Weighted vertex coloring","","","","","","","","Aardal K.I., Van Hoesel S.P.M., Koster A.M.C.A., Mannino C., Sassano A., Models and solution techniques for the frequency assignment problem, 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1, 4, pp. 261-317, (2003); Avanthay C., Hertz A., Zufferey N., A variable neighborhood search for graph coloring, European Journal of Operational Research, 151, pp. 379-388, (2003); Blochliger I., Zufferey N., A reactive tabu search using partial solutions for the graph coloring problem, Computers and Operations Research, 35, 3, pp. 960-975, (2008); Bodlaender H.L., Jansen K., On the complexity of scheduling incompatible jobs with unit-times, MFCS ′93: Proceedings of the 18th International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 291-300, (1993); Bollobas B., Thomason A., Random graphs of small order, Annals of Discrete Mathematics, 28, pp. 47-97, (1985); Boudhar M., Finke G., Scheduling on a batch machine with job compatibilities, Belgian Journal of Operations Research, Statistics and Computer Science, 40, 1-2, pp. 874-885, (2000); Brelaz D., New methods to color the vertices of a graph, Communications of the ACM, 22, 4, pp. 251-256, (1979); Brown R., Chromatic scheduling and the chromatic number problem, Management Science, 19, 4, pp. 456-463, (1972); Campelo M., Correa R., Frota Y., Cliques, holes and the vertex coloring polytope, Information Processing Letters, 89, 4, pp. 159-164, (2004); Campelo M., Campos V.A., Correa R., On the asymmetric representatives formulation for the vertex coloring problem, Discrete Applied Mathematics, 156, 7, pp. 1097-1111, (2008); Caprara A., Fischetti M., -Chvátal-Gomory cuts, Mathematical Programming, 74, pp. 221-235, (1996); Caprara A., Fischetti M., Toth P., A heuristic method for the set covering problem, Operations Research, 47, pp. 730-743, (1999); Caprara A., Kroon L., Monaci M., Peeters M., Toth P., Passenger railway optimization, Transportation, Handbook in Operations Research and Management Science 14, pp. 129-187, (2007); Chiarandini M., Dumitrescu I., Stutzle T., Stochastic local search algorithms for the graph colouring problem, Handbook of Approximation Algorithms and Metaheuristics.

We demonstrated how rigorously constructed and well-defined network measures can capture not only the network topology underlying a particular critical system, but also the underlying behavior of decision-makers, the resulting flows, and induced costs in the reality of demands for resources, whether fixed or elastic (price-dependent). In addition, we reviewed how to determine the synergy associated with network integration, with a focus on supply chains, as may occur not only in corporate applications, such as in mergers and acquisitions, but also in humanitarian ones, as in the case of the creation of teams and partnerships for humanitarian logistics. We illustrated the concepts and tools in this paper, which are based on numerous publications, through a spectrum of applications and numerical examples. Because the number of disasters is growing globally, it is imperative to have transparent, well-understood, and appropriate tools for the determination of network vulnerability and robustness, as critical infrastructure networks from transportation, telecommunications, supply chains, to financial and electric power ones, provide the ties that bind our economies and societies together. Local disruptions can have global impacts. Only when network components are identified as to their importance and rankings can decision-makers and policy analysts, as well as planners and engineers, understand in an objective way which components should be maintained and protected the most, with implications for disaster and emergency preparedness as well as national security. © 2010 The Authors.

The objective function is to find a balance between these penalities and the cost of the tour. We call this problem the Profitable Tour Problem (PTP). If, in addition, each vertex is associated with a prize and there is a knapsack constraint which guarantees that a sufficiently large prize is collected, we have the well-known Prize-collecting Travelling Salesman Problem (PCTSP). In this paper we summarize the main results presented in the literature, then we give lower bounds for the asymmetric version of PTP and PCTSP. Moreover, we show, through computational experiments, that large size instances of the asymmetric PTP can be solved exactly. © 1995.","asymmetric travelling salesman problem; Lagrangean relaxation; lower bounds; prize-collecting","","","","","","Italian Ministry of University and Scientific and Technological Research; KFB; Stifteisen Wenner-Gren Center; Swedish Transport and Communications Research Board","Acknowledgeme- nWtse thank Professors Fischetti and Toth who made available to us the code of bound LB 1.

The paper undertakes quantitative analyses and visualization of the temporal trends, from VA's emergence in 2000 to the end of 2019. The trend analysis helps to forecast future growth in the research and practice of VA. The study highlights four outcomes. First, there is a robust direct relationship among the variables, including VA's growth on the Google trends, the scientific literature production (SLP), and usage of the published documents. Second, the SLP's growth pattern highlights VA's popularity as an emerging field with an overall annual increase of 17.4%. The high citation counts of the published scholarship indicate a significant impact and a continuous growth of the VA field. Third, VA contributes to diverse disciplines other than computer science and information systems, from business and economics to engineering, healthcare, biomedical and chemical sciences, and arts and humanities. VA helps researchers and practitioners in multidisciplinary fields analyze multidimensional data, enhance data visualization, knowledge discovery, generating insights, and make informed decisions. On the reverse, other disciplines contribute to propelling VA's popularity through research productivity, usage, and citation impacts. Finally, a trend analysis predicts sustained future growth of VA technology in research and practice to dissect and sensemaking of the increasingly massive and complex data structures, which is now the norm in many fields. © 2021 The Authors.

The liner shipping problem is a multi-trip vehicle routing problem, and consists of deciding weekly routes for the selected ships. A solution method consisting of three phases is presented. In phase 1, all feasible single routes are generated for the largest ship available. Some of these routes will use only a small portion of the ship's capacity and can be performed by smaller ships at less cost. This fact is used when calculating the cost of each route. In phase 2, the single routes generated in phase 1 are combined into multiple routes. By solving a set partitioning problem (phase 3), where the columns are the routes generated in phases 1 and 2, we find both the optimal fleet and the coherent routes for the fleet. © 1999 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Fleet optimisation; Liner shipping; Multiple trips; Routing; Ships","","","","","","","","Ball M.O., Golden B., Assad A., Bodin L.D., Planning for truck fleet size in the presence of a common-carrier option, Decision Sciences, 14, 1, pp. 103-120, (1983); Bausch D.O., Brown G.G., Ronen D., Scheduling short-term marine transport of bulk products, Maritime Policy and Management, 25, 4, pp. 335-348, (1998); Bodin L.D., Golden B., Assad A., Ball M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: the state of the art, Computers and Operations Research, 10, 2, pp. 63-211, (1983); Brandao J., Mercer A., A tabu search algorithm for the multi-trip vehicle routing and scheduling problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 100, pp. 180-191, (1997); Brandao J., Mercer A., The multi-trip vehicle routing problem, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, pp. 799-805, (1998); Brown G.G., Graves G.W., Ronen D., Scheduling ocean transportation of crude oil, Management Science, 33, 3, pp. 335-346, (1987); Clarke G., Wright J., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points, Operations Research, 12, pp. 568-581, (1964); Dantzig G.B., Fulkerson D.R., Minimizing the number of tankers to meet a fixed schedule, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 1, pp. 217-222, (1954); Desaulniers G., Desrosiers J., Dumas Y., Solomon M.M., Soumis F., Daily aircraft routing and scheduling, Management Science, 43, 6, pp. 841-855, (1997); Desrochers M., Verhoog T.W., A new heuristic for the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem, Computers and Operations Research, 18, 3, pp. 263-274, (1991); Etezadi T., Beasley J.E., Vehicle fleet composition, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 34, pp. 87-91, (1983); Fagerholt K., A multi-trip ship routing problem, (1998); Fagerholt K., Christiansen M., Multi-product ship scheduling problem with flexible cargo holds: An optimisation based heuristic approach, (1998); Fisher M.L., Rosenwein M.B., An interactive optimization system for bulk-cargo ship scheduling, Naval Research Logistics, 36, pp. 27-42, (1989); Laporte G., Osman I.H., Routing problems: a bibliography, Annals of Operations Research, 61, pp. 227-262, (1995); Murotsu Y., Taguchi K., On optimum selection of ship fleet-size for investment purposes, Operational Research 1975, pp. 301-322, (1976); Taillard E.D., Laporte G., Gendreau M., Vehicle routing with multiple use of vehicles, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 47, pp. 1065-1070, (1996)","","","","","","","","","09696016","","","","English","Int.

Recent years have seen a marked increase in the number of papers examining a variant of the container loading problem ranging from largely theoretical to implementations that focus on meeting the many critical real-world constraints. In this paper, we review the literature focusing on the solution methodologies employed by researchers, with the aim of providing insight into some of the critical algorithmic design issues. In addition, we provide an extensive comparison of algorithm performance across the benchmark literature. © 2015 The Authors.","Container loading; Cutting and packing; Review","Algorithms; Benchmarking;

More recently, however, with decreasing birth rates in nearly all of the developed countries and increasing average longevity globally, optimisation issues in Healthcare have become noticeably important and attract keen interest from the Operations Research community. Over the years, attention has gradually expanded from resource allocation and strategic planning to include operational issues such as resource scheduling and treatment planning. This paper surveys several applications of Operations Research in the domain of Healthcare. In particular, the paper reviews key contributions addressing contemporary optimisation issues in this area. It highlights current research activities, focusing on a variety of optimisation problems as well as solution techniques used for solving the optimisation problems. © 2010 The Authors.

Successful real-world cases, however, are rare since horizontal cooperation in logistics is not usually sustainable. This paper pays attention to this paradox of the lack of cases and discusses 16 identified practical issues that could explain this phenomenon. We propose a taxonomy composed of four categories categorizing the practical issues according to a value chain approach: design, planning and operations, market/business, and behaviors. Furthermore, we propose and discuss some measures to mitigate these problems.                          © 2018 The Authors.

Thus, new experiments with MTP have been performed on instances from more challenging problem classes: Our results confirm the general opinion that MTP represents the state-or-the-art for exact solution methods for the BPP, even though the size of the problems, which can be solved to a proven optimum in reasonable computing time, still appears to be unsatisfactory. © 1997 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bin-packing; FFD packing; Heuristics; MTP; Numerical experiments","","","","","","","","Coffman E.G., Garey M.R., Johnson D.S., Approximation algorithms for bin-packing - an updated survey, Algorithm Desiyn for Computer System Design, pp. 49-106, (1984); Dyckhoff H., A typology of cutting and packing problems, European Journal of Operational Research, 44, pp. 145-159, (1990); Eilon S., Christofides N., The loading problem, Management Science, 17, pp. 259-267, (1971); Falkenauer E., Tapping the full power of genetic algorithm through suitable representation and local optimization: Application to bin packing, Evolutionary Algorithms in Management Applications, pp. 167-182, (1995); Garey M.R., Johnson D.S., Computers and Intractability.

It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies. © 2020 The Authors.

It is receiving attention from Japanese practitioners and researchers. However, some attempts to implement seru production are unsuccessful, especially outside Japan. This is because of lack of knowledge of the specific means to implement seru production. The purpose of this paper is to provide a general framework and some basic principles that should be followed while implementing seru production for practitioners from a practical perspective. This work is based on a systematic analysis of many implementation experiences of seru production in Japanese manufacturing factories as well as a broad investigation of the popular literature information. The proposed framework can serve as a concise guide to help implement seru production in the manufacturing industry. In addition, constructive information is provided for researchers who would like to know and study the advanced manufacturing mode of seru production but do not understand the Japanese language. © 2013 The Authors.","Assembly cell; Cellular manufacturing; Japanese electronics manufacturing industry; Manufacturing systems design","Management; Manufacture; Advanced manufacturing; Assembly cells; Electronics assembly; Electronics manufacturing industry; Environment friendly; Japanese manufacturing; Manufacturing industries; Sustainable manufacturing; Cellular manufacturing","","","","","","","Akino S., Internationalization of Japanese company and change of production system (in Japanese), Rikkyo Economic Review, 51, 1, pp. 29-55, (1997); Akiyama S., Ootsuka N., Kudou J., Seru production in Sony (in Japanese), Robot, 126, pp. 48-50, (1999); Burbidge J.L., Group Technology in the Engineering Industry, (1979); Endou S., Construction of seru production system and improvement of performance (in Japanese), IE Review, 45, 2, pp. 22-28, (2004); Georgellis Y., Lange T., Participation in continuous, on-the-job training and the impact on job satisfaction: longitudinal evidence from the German labour market, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 18, 6, pp. 969-985, (2007); Hasegawa K., Fukuta Y., Saito M., A study on the workload in seru production (in Japanese), The Japanese Journal of Ergonomics, 45, 4, pp. 219-225, (2009); Isa K., Tsuru T., Cell production and workplace innovation in Japan: toward a new model for Japanese manufacturing?, Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society, 41, 4, pp. 548-578, (2002); Iwamuro H., An Easy Book About Seru Production, (2004); Changes in Manufacturing Systems and Technologies, (2005); Cell Manufacturing System and the Innovation of Manufacturing System, (1998); Kaihara T., Yao Y., Fujii N., Interdivisional production scheduling with social negotiation mechanism, CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology, 60, 1, pp. 461-464, (2011); Kaku I., Gong J., Tang J., Yin Y., Modeling and numerical analysis of line-cell conversion problems, International Journal of Production Research, 47, 8, pp. 2055-2078, (2009); Kaku I., Murase Y., Yin Y., A study on human-task-related performances in converting conveyor assembly line to cellular manufacturing, European Journal of Industrial Engineering, 2, 1, pp. 17-34, (2008); Kimura T., Yoshita M., Seru production runs into trouble when nothing is done (in Japanese), Nikkei Monozukuri, 7, pp. 38-61, (2004); Kon T., Inviolable rules of seru production practice tied to administration effectiveness (in Japanese), Plant Management, 50, 10, pp. 12-21, (2004); Leppel K., Brucker E., Cochran J., The importance of job training to job satisfaction of older workers, Journal of Aging and Social Policy, 24, 1, pp. 62-76, (2012); Liu C.G., Bai Y., Li W.J., Lian J., Yin Y., Decision making on production mode selection for manufacturing enterprises under two types of market structure (in Chinese), Systems Engineering-Theory & Practice, 32, 1, pp. 49-59, (2012); Liu C.G., Li W.J., Lian J., Yin Y., Reconfiguration of assembly systems: from conveyor assembly line to serus, Journal of Manufacturing System, 31, 3, pp. 312-325, (2012); Liu C.G., Lian J., Yin Y., Li W.J., Seru seisan-an innovation of the production management model in Japan, Asian Journal of Technology Innovation, 18, 2, pp. 89-113, (2010); Matsuo T., Analytical framework of causal relationship between seru production and performance: approach from the concept definition (in Japanese), Economic and Business Review, Kyushu Sangyo University, 47, 1, pp. 89-102, (2006); Miyake D.I., The shift from belt conveyor line to work-cell based assembly systems to cope with increasing demand variation in Japanese industries, International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management, 6, 4, pp. 419-439, (2006); Nakamura H., An investigation on the establishment of seru production mode as a MOT innovation in Japan (in Japanese), Journal of Creative Management, 2, 1, pp. 187-199, (2006); Nomura T., Practical use after introducing seru production (in Japanese), IE Review, 45, 2, pp. 47-50, (2004); Nordhaug O., Reward Functions of Personnel Training, Human Relation, 42, 5, pp. 373-388, (2004); Rizk N., Martel A., D'Amours S., Multi-item dynamic production-distribution planning in process industries with divergent finishing stages, Computers & Operations Research, 33, 12, pp. 3600-3623, (2006); Sakamaki H., The Change of Consciousness and Company by Cellular Manufacturing in Canon Way, (2006); Sakazume Y., Why it is necessary to facilitate continuous improvement activities after introducing seru production (in Japanese), IE Review, 45, 2, pp. 6-13, (2004); Sakazume Y., Is Japanese cell manufacturing a new system?

We provide an extensive and comprehensive review of the existing literature on local governments' efficiency from a global point of view, covering all articles from 1990 to August 2016. This paper is the first of two. It covers the basic aspects related to local governments' efficiency measurement not taking into account the effect of environmental conditions. First, we show a detailed overview of the studies investigating public sector efficiency across various countries, comparing the data and samples employed, and the main results obtained. Second, we describe which techniques have been used for measuring efficiency in the context of local governments. Third, we summarize the inputs and outputs used. Finally, we discuss some operative directions and considerations for further research in the field. © 2017 The Authors.

By reinterpreting and extending the metafrontier literature, we propose an all-embracing concept to fully capture the operational environment.

Notwithstanding the simplicity of the heuristic, which they call the “improved Clarke and Wright savings algorithm” (ICW), the reported results are among the best heuristics ever developed for this problem. Through a careful reimplementation, we demonstrate that the results published in the paper could not have been produced by the ICW heuristic. Studying the reasons how this paper could have passed the peer review process to be published in an ISI-ranked journal, we have to conclude that the necessary conditions for a thorough examination of a typical paper in the field of optimization are generally lacking. We investigate how this can be improved and come to the conclusion that disclosing source code to reviewers should become a prerequisite for publication. © 2017 The Authors.

We consider a problem that occurs in the aftermath of a natural disaster: a transportation system for supplying disaster victims with relief goods must be established. We propose bi-objective optimization models with a monetary objective and humanitarian objective. Uncertainty in the accessibility of the road network is modeled by a discrete set of scenarios. The key features of our model are the determination of locations for intermediate depots and acquisition of vehicles. Several model variants are considered. First, the operating budget can be fixed at the first stage for all possible scenarios or determined for each scenario at the second stage. Second, the assignment of vehicles to a depot can be either fixed or free. Third, we compare a heterogeneous vehicle fleet to a homogeneous fleet. We study the impact of the variants on the solutions. The set of Pareto-optimal solutions is computed by applying the adaptive Epsilon-constraint method. We solve the deterministic equivalents of the two-stage stochastic programs using the MIP-solver CPLEX. © 2015 The Authors.

Recently, however, other evaluation aspects, such as environmental concerns, were also given an explicit role as objective functions in mathematical models. Models become thus more realistic so that decision makers are able to grasp the inherent conflicts and trade-offs among the distinct objectives in selecting a best compromise plan. A significant change in the planning processes has also occurred concerning new planning methodologies integrating demand-side management (DSM) techniques, in an attempt to change the levels and forms of electricity use by the consumers. This paper presents a multiple objective linear programming model for power generation expansion planning incorporating DSM. The objective functions are the total expansion cost, the environmental impact associated with the installed power capacity and the environmental impact associated with the energy output. DSM is included by modelling it as a new generating group along with the generating alternatives from the supply side. Five categories of constraints are considered related to the reliability of the supply system, the availability of the generating units, the capacity of the DSM-equivalent generating group, the total capacity installed throughout the planning period, the pollutant emissions. Some results are presented derived by using an interactive method, aimed at assisting decision makers in a progressive and selective search of good compromise solutions. © 1996 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Decision support systems; Demand-side management; Integrated resource planning; Mathematical modelling; Multiple objective linear programming; Power generation planning","","","","","","","","Antunes C.H., Climaco J., Sensitivity analyses in MCDM using the weight space, Operations Research Letters, 12, pp. 187-196, (1992); Beglari F., Laughton M., Model building with particular reference to power system planning: The improved z-substitutes method, Energy Policy, 2, (1974); Bernow S., Ackerman F., Biewald B., Fulmer M., Shapiro K., Wulfsberg K., Direct environmental impacts of demand-side management, Proc: Of the ACEEE 1992 Summer Study on Energy, Efficiency in Buildings, 9, pp. 19-31, (1992); Climaco J., Antunes C.H., Implementation of a user-friendly software package-a guided tour of TRIMAP, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 12, pp. 1299-1309, (1989); Climaco J., Antunes C.H., A comparison of microcomputer implemented interactive MOLP methods based on a case study, Readings in Multiple Criteria Decision Aid, pp. 445-470, (1990); Climaco J., Antunes C.H., Martins A., Marta J., Almeida A.T., A multiple objective linear programming model for power generation expansion planning, International Journal of Energy Research, 19, pp. 419-432, (1995); Gellings C.W., The concept of demand-side management for electric utilities, Proc: Of the IEEE, 73, pp. 1468-1470, (1985); Hobbs B.F., Optimization methods for electric utility resource planning, European Journal of Operational Research, 83, pp. 1-20, (1995); House P., Coleman J., Schull R., Matheny R., Hock J., Comparing energy technology alternatives from an environmental perspective, (1981); Ottinger R.L., Wooly D.R., Robinson N.A., Hodas D.R., Bobb S.E., Environmental Costs of Electricity, (1991); The environmental impact of electrical power generation: Nuclear and fossil, (1975); Sanghvi A., Balu N., Lauby M., Power system reliability planning practice in North America, IEEE Trans: On Power Systems, 6, pp. 1485-1491, (1991)","","","","","","","","","09696016","","","","English","Int.
