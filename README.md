## Quantitative-Models-for-Economics

This repository hosts the final project (***`Final_Project_Work_GroupM`***) for the Quantitative Methods in Economics exam, instructed by Professor Cinzia Daraio, as part of the Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science at Sapienza University of Rome. The project demonstrates our group's collective efforts and key findings.

### **Exam Structure**

The exam in Quantitative Models for Economics consisted of two assignments and a final project, detailed here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Project Overview**

In the final project we were asked to re-do the case study on ITOR publications described in Section 4 of the paper ***Int Trans Operational Res - 2023 - Avenali - Systematic reviews as a metaknowledge tool  caveats and a review of available options*** by using the tools of Systematic Reviews that we saw in class.

For this project, we first conducted a traditional "manual" Systematic Review of the literature. We then enhanced our analysis by integrating Artificial Intelligence tools that were introduced during the course. The objective was to compare and contrast the outcomes derived from manual methods with those generated through AI-driven approaches.

The results of our comparative study are documented in the final section of our paper, which is available in this repository.

### **Visualization Tools**

For some of our visualizations, we used a library within R called `biblioshiny`, which is part of the bibliometrix package. Detailed setup instructions are provided in the ***bibliometrix.R*** file available in this repository.<br> 
To use biblioshiny for interactive graphing, you can launch it by executing `biblioshiny()` in R after installing the required packages outlined in the provided code.
Additionally, the .R file includes scripts for conducting preliminary analyses on abstracts sourced from *Scopus* and *Web of Science*, which are also available in this repository.

All the `.csv` and `.bib` files included in this repository contain the abstracts from *Scopus* and *Web of Science*, essential for generating the majority of the graphs presented in the project, as well as for conducting the preliminary analyses using R.

### **Exam Score and Project Usage**

**This project (plus the homeworks) received a perfect score of 30 out of 30 on the final exam.** Feel free to use it as a reference if you are planning to take the exam in the upcoming years.<br>
