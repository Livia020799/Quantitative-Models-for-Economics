## Quantitative-Models-for-Economics

Repository to store the final project of QME exam (`Final_Project_Work_GroupM`) from my master in Data Science at Sapienza University

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The exam in Quantitive Models for Economics was structured in 2 homeworks and a final project, that I am reporting here. 
In the final project we were asked to re-do the case study on ITOR publications described in Section 4 of the paper Avenali et al. (2023), uploaded here in this GitHub repository, using the tools of Systematic Reviews that we saw in class. After having completed the "manual review", we had to try to apply as much as possible the Artificial Intelligence tools presented in class.
So, basically, we had to to re-do the case study on ITOR publications described in the paper `Int Trans Operational Res - 2023 - Avenali - Systematic reviews as a metaknowledge tool  caveats and a review of available`, by employing both a "manual" Systematic Review and one driven by Artificial Intelligence tools.

You can see the outcomes of this project in in final section of our paper.
