From a review of quantitative and more qualitative managerial literature, we believe that Supply Chain Management should be concerned with the reduction or even elimination of uncertainties to improve the performance of the chain. The following clusters of sources of uncertainty are identified: order forecast horizon, input data, administrative and decision processes and inherent uncertainties. For each source of uncertainty, several improvement principles are identified. A case study was conducted in a food chain in which a simulation model helped quantify the effects of alternative configurations and operational management concepts. By comparing this simulation study with a pilot study, the model is validated against real data, and organisational consequences are identified. The results of the case study suggest that reduction of uncertainties can improve service levels significantly, although current supply chain configurations restrict possible benefits. The availability of real-time information systems is found to be a requirement for obtaining efficient and effective Supply Chain Management concepts. © 1998 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Chain simulation model; Continuous replenishment; Pilot study; Supply chain management; Uncertainty","","","","","","","","Axsater S., Continuous review policies for multi-level inventory systems with stochastic demand, Logistics of Production and Inventory, 4, (1993); van Beek P., Modelling and analysis of a multi-echelon inventory system, European Journal of Operational Research, 6, pp. 380-385, (1981); Beulens A.J.M., Information technology and society; intriguing integration, (1992); Bourland K., Powell S., Pyke D.F., Exploiting timely demand information to reduce inventories, European Journal of Operational Research, 92, 2, pp. 239-253, (1996); Braithway A., Logistic systems or customer focused organisation; which comes first, Logistics Information Management, 6, 4, pp. 26-37, (1993); Cachon G.P., Exact evaluation of batch-ordering policies in two-echelon supply chains with periodic review, (1995); Cachon G.P., Fisher M., Campbell soup's continuous replenishment program: evaluation and enhanced inventory decision rules, (1996); Cachon G.P., Fisher M., Supply chain inventory management and the value of shared information, (1997); Chen F., Zheng Y.S., One-warehouse multi-retailer systems with centralized stock information, Operations Research, 45, pp. 275-287, (1995); Van der Duyn Schouten F.A., Van Eijs M.J.G., Heuts R.M.J., The value of supplier information to improve management of a retailer's inventory, Decision Science, 25, 1, pp. 1-14, (1994); Ellram L.M., Supply chain management; the industrial organisation perspective, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 21, 1, pp. 13-22, (1991); Fearne A., Editorial note, Supply Chain Management, 1, 1, pp. 3-4, (1996); Forrester J.W., Industrial Dynamics, (1961); Harland C., The dynamics of customer dissatisfaction in supply chains, International Journal of Production Planning and Control, 6, 3, pp. 209-217, (1995); Hill T., Manufacturing strategy: The strategic management of the manufacturing function, (1993); Iyer A.V., Bergen M.E., Quick response in manufacturer-retailer channels, Management Science, 43, 4, pp. 559-570, (1997); Jones T.C., Riley D.W., Using inventory for competitive advantage through supply chain management, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Materials Management, 15, 5, pp. 16-26, (1985); Kreuwels C.M.A., External logistical integration and EDI: To multi-level supply control between supplier and buyer, Ph.D. Dissertation, (1994); Efficient Consumer Response; enhancing consumer value in the grocery industry, (1993); Lee H.L., Padmanabhan V., Whang S., Information distortion in a supply chain: The bullwhip effect, Management Science, 43, 4, pp. 546-558, (1997); Lewis J.C., Naim M.M., Benchmarking of aftermarket supply chains, International Journal of Production Planning and Control, 6, 3, pp. 258-269, (1995); McGuffog T., The obligation to keep value chain management simple and standard, Supply Chain Management, 2, 4, pp. 124-133, (1997); Moinzadeh K., Aggarwal P.K., An information based multi-echelon inventory system with emergency orders, Operations Research, (1996); Scott S., Westbrook R., New strategic tools for supply chain management, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 21, 1, pp. 23-33, (1991); Silver E.A., Modelling in support of continuous improvements towards achieving world class operations, Perspectives in Operations Management, (1991); Stalk G., Hout T.M., Competing against time; how time-based competition is reshaping global markets, (1990); Stevens G.C., Integrating the supply chain, International Journal of Physical Distribution and Materials Management, 19, 8, pp. 3-8, (1989); Svoronos A., Zipkin P., Estimating the performance of multi-level inventory systems, Operations Research, 36, 1, pp. 57-72, (1988); Thiery M., Salomon M., Van Nunen J., Van Wassenhove L., Strategic issues in product recovery management, California Management Review, 37, 2, pp. 114-135, (1995); Towill D.R., Time compression and supply chain management—a guided tour, Supply Chain Management, 1, 1, pp. 15-27, (1996); Verrijdt J.H.C.M., Design and control of service part distribution systems, Ph.D. Dissertation, (1997); Van der Vorst J.G.A.J., Beulens A.J.M., Van Beek P., Redesigning food supply chains: An integral logistical approach, pp. 77-90, (1998)","","","","","","","","","09696016","","","","English","Int.

In the first stage, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is run for each pair of units separately. In the second stage, the pairwise evaluation matrix generated in the first stage is utilized to rank scale the units via the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The consistency of this AHP/DEA evaluation can be tested statistically. Its goodness of fit with the DEA classification (to efficient/inefficient) can also be tested using non-parametric tests. Both DEA and AHP are commonly used in practice. Both have limitations. The hybrid model AHP/DEA takes the best of both models, by avoiding the pitfalls of each. The nonaxiomatic utility theory limitations of AHP are irrelevant here: since we are working with given inputs and outputs of units, no subjective assessment of a decision maker evaluation is involved. AHP/DEA ranking does not replace the DEA classification model, rather it furthers the analysis by providing full ranking in the DEA context for all units, efficient and inefficient. © 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Analytical hierarchical process (AHP); Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Decision theory; Efficiency; Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); Ranking; Scaling","","","","","","","","Barzilai J., Cook W.D., Golany B., Consistent weights for judgements matrices of a relative importance of alternatives, Operations Research Letters, 6, 3, pp. 131-134, (1987); Belton V., An IDEA-integrating data envelopment analysis with multiple criteria analysis, Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Multiple Criteria Decision Making: Theory and Applications in Business, Industry and Commerce, pp. 71-79, (1992); Belton V., Vickers S.P., Demystifying DBA— a visual interactive approach based on multiple criteria analysis, J.

The behavior of virtually any species of insects, the flow of water, musicians playing together - it seems that no idea is too far-fetched to serve as inspiration to launch yet another metaheuristic. In this paper, we will argue that this line of research is threatening to lead the area of metaheuristics away from scientific rigor. We will examine the historical context that gave rise to the increasing use of metaphors as inspiration and justification for the development of new methods, discuss the reasons for the vulnerability of the metaheuristics field to this line of research, and point out its fallacies. At the same time, truly innovative research of high quality is being performed as well. We conclude the paper by discussing some of the properties of this research and by pointing out some of the most promising research avenues for the field of metaheuristics. © 2013 The Authors.","Combinatorial optimization; Heuristics; Metaheuristics; Optimization","Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristics; High quality; Innovative research; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic methods; Metaheuristic; Optimization","","","","","","","Abidin Z.Z., Ngah U.K., Arshad M.R., Ping O.B., A novel fly optimization algorithm for swarming application, pp. 425-428, (2010); Adenso-Diaz B., Laguna M., Fine-tuning of algorithms using fractional experimental designs and local search, Operations Research, 54, 1, pp. 99-114, (2006); (2010); Atashpaz-Gargari E., Lucas C., Imperialist competitive algorithm: an algorithm for optimization inspired by imperialistic competition, pp. 4661-4667, (2007); Barr R.S., Golden B.L., Kelly J.P., Resende M.G.C., Stewart W.R., Designing and reporting on computational experiments with heuristic methods, Journal of Heuristics, 1, 1, pp. 9-32, (1995); Burke E.K., Curtois T., Hyde M., Kendall G., Ochoa G., Petrovic S., Vazquez-Rodriguez J.A., Towards the decathlon challenge of search heuristics, Workshop on Automated Heuristic Design - In conjunction with the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO-2009), (2009); Cotta C., Sevaux M., Sorensen K., Adaptive and Multilevel Metaheuristics, (2008); Coy S.P., Golden B.L., Runger G.C., Wasil E.A., Using experimental design to find effective parameter settings for heuristics, Journal of Heuristics, 7, 1, pp. 77-97, (2001); De Corte A., Sorensen K., Optimisation of water distribution network design: a critical review, (2012); Dorigo M., Optimization, learning and natural algorithms, (1992); Duin C., Voss S., The Pilot method: A strategy for heuristic repetition with application to the Steiner problem in graphs, Networks, 34, 3, pp. 181-191, (1999); Dumitrescu I., Stutzle T., Usage of exact algorithms to enhance stochastic local search algorithms, Matheuristics: Hybridizing Metaheuristics and Mathematical Programming, 10, (2009); Geem Z.W., Survival of the fittest algorithm or the novelest algorithm?: The existence reason of the harmony search algorithm, International Journal of Applied Metaheuristic Computing, 1, 4, pp. 76-80, (2010); Geem Z.W., Kim J.H., Loganathan G.V., A new heuristic optimization algorithm: harmony search, Simulation, 76, 2, pp. 60-68, (2001); Glover F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence, Computers and Operations Research, 13, pp. 533-549, (1986); Glover F., Heuristics for integer programming using surrogate constraints, Decision Sciences, 8, 1, pp. 156-166, (1997); Glover F., Laguna M., Tabu Search, (1997); Goldberg D.E., Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning, (1989); Haddad O.B., Afshar A., Marino M.A., Honey-bees mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm: a new heuristic approach for water resources optimization, Water Resources Management, 20, 5, pp. 661-680, (2006); Hedayatzadeh R., Akhavan Salmassi F., Keshtgari M., Akbari R., Ziarati K., Termite colony optimization: a novel approach for optimizing continuous problems, 18th Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE), pp. 553-558, (2010); Hooker J.N., Testing heuristics: We have it all wrong, Journal of Heuristics, 1, 1, pp. 33-42, (1995); Karaboga D., An idea based on honey bee swarm for numerical optimization, (2005); Kirkpatrick S., Gelatt C.J., Vecchi M.P., Optimization by simulated annealing, Science, 220, 4598, pp. 671-680, (1983); Kramer O., Self-adaptive Heuristics for Evolutionary Computation, (2008); Krishnanand K.N., Ghose D., Detection of multiple source locations using a glowworm metaphor with applications to collective robotics, Swarm Intelligence Symposium, pp. 84-91, (2005); Laarhoven P.J.M., Aarts E.H.L., Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications, (1987); Lukasik S., Zak S., Firefly algorithm for continuous constrained optimization tasks, Computational Collective Intelligence.

These algorithms take inspiration from physics, biology, social sciences, and use a certain amount of repeated trials, given by one or more ‘agents’ operating with a mechanism of competition-cooperation. Two introductory sections, devoted respectively to a presentation of some general concepts and to a tentative classification of Heuristics from Nature open the work. The paper is then composed of six review sections: each of them concerns a heuristic and its application to an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We consider the following topics: genetic algorithms with timetable problems, simulated annealing with dial-a-ride problems, sampling and clustering with communication spanning tree problems, tabu search with job-shop-scheduling problems, neural nets with location problems, ant system with travelling salesman and quadratic assignment problems. © 1996 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Metahewlistics comparison; Np-hard optimization; Single and multiagent search","","","","","","","","Aarts E., Korst J., Simulated Annealing and Boltzmann Machines, (1989); Angeniol B., DeLaCroix-Vaubois G., LeTexier J., Self-organizing feature maps and the TSP, pp. 289-293, (1988); Barahona F., On the computational complexity of using spin glass models, J.

The quality of the PGA is demonstrated by an extensive comparative test including well-known reference problems and loading procedures from other authors.

Efficiency can be measured in, for example, lower cost or more flexibility. An important aspect of the collaboration is to decide on how to share the benefits-for example, cost, profit, or resources. There are many sharing mechanisms or cost allocations proposed in the literature. Some are based on simple proportional rules and others are based on theoretical concepts found in game theory. We provide a survey on cost allocation methods found in the literature on collaborative transportation, including problems on planning, vehicle routing, traveling salesman, distribution, and inventory. A total of 55 scientific articles compose the main part of the survey, most of them published between 2010 and 2015. We identify more than 40 cost allocation methods used in this stream of literature. We describe the theoretical basis for the main methods as well as the cases where they are used. We also report savings from the collaborations when they are based on industrial data. Some directions for future research are discussed. © 2016 The Authors.","Collaborative logistics; Cost allocation; Game theory; Group decisions and negotiations; Transportation","Amphibious vehicles;

It is a multi-start or iterative process, in which each GRASP iteration consists of two phases, a construction phase, in which a feasible solution is produced, and a local search phase, in which a local optimum in the neighborhood of the constructed solution is sought. Since 1989, numerous papers on the basic aspects of GRASP, as well as enhancements to the basic metaheuristic have appeared in the literature. GRASP has been applied to a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems, ranging from scheduling and routing to drawing and turbine balancing. This is the first of two papers with an annotated bibliography of the GRASP literature from 1989 to 2008.

This paper presents a new approach to the selection of compensatory MADM methods for a specific cardinal ranking problem via sensitivity analysis of attribute weights. In line with the context-dependent concept of informational importance, the approach examines the consistency degree between the relative degree of sensitivity of individual attributes using an MADM method and the relative degree of influence of the corresponding attributes indicated by Shannon’s entropy concept. The approach favors the method that has the highest consistency degree as it best reflects the decision information embedded in the problem data set. An empirical study of a scholarship student selection problem is used to illustrate how the approach can validate the ranking outcome produced by different MADM methods. The empirical study shows that different problem data sets may result in a different method being selected. This approach is particularly applicable to large-scale cardinal ranking problems where the ranking outcome of different methods differs significantly.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques are used to reduce container handling/transfer times and ships' time at the port by speeding up handling operations. The GA is chosen due to the relatively good results that have been reported even with the simplest GA implementations to obtain near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. Also discussed, is the application of the model to assess the consequences of increased scheduled throughput time as well as different strategies such as the alternative plant layouts, storage policies and number of yard machines.

However, the choice of a particular algorithm to optimize a certain problem is still mainly driven by some sort of devotion of its author to a certain technique rather than by a rationalistic choice driven by reason. Hybrid algorithms have shown their ability to provide local optima of high quality. Hybridization of algorithms is still in its infancy: certain combinations of algorithms have experimentally shown their performance, though the reasons of their success is not always really clear. In order to add some rational to these issues, we study the structure of search spaces and attempt to relate it to the performance of algorithms. We wish to explain the behavior of search algorithms with this knowledge and provide guidelines in the design of hybrid algorithms. This paper briefly reviews the current knowledge we have on search spaces of combinatorial optimization problems. Then, we discuss hybridization and present a general classification of the way hybridization can be conducted in the light of our knowledge of the structure of search spaces. © 1999 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid algorithms; Parallel meta-heuristics","","","","","","","","Bachelet V., Hafidi Z., Preux P., Talbi E.-G., Vers la coopération de métaheuristiques parallèles, Calculateurs Parallèles, Réseaux et Systèmes Répartis, 10, 2, pp. 211-223, (1998); Bachelet V., Preux P., Talbi E.-G., Parallel optimization colloquium POC96, (1996); Badeau P., Gendreau M., Guertin F., Potvin J.-Y., Taillard E., A parallel tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows, (1995); Brown D.E., Huntley C.L., Spillane A.R., A parallel genetic heuristic for the quadratic assignment problem, pp. 406-415, (1989); Chu P.C., A genetic algorithm approach for combinatorial optimization problems, Ph.D. thesis, (1997); Crainic T.G., Nguyen A.T., Gendreau M., Cooperative multi-thread parallel tabu search with evolutionary adaptive memory, (1997); Dorigo M., Gambardella L., Ant colony system: a cooperative learning approach to the traveling salesman problem, IEEE Trans. on Evolutionary Computation, 1, 1, (1997); Duvivier D., Preux P., Talbi E.-G., Climbing-up N P-hard Hills, Parallel problem solving from nature (PPSN'96), 1141, pp. 574-583, (1996); Esbensen H., A macro-cell global router based on two genetic algorithms, pp. 428-433, (1994); Fleurent C.C., Ferland J.A., Genetic hybrids for the quadratic assignment problem, DIMACS Ser.

Notably, logistic companies have given close attention to these vehicles to reduce delivery time and operational cost. A variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called the flying sidekick traveling salesman problem, was introduced involving drone-assisted parcel delivery. The drone launches from the truck, proceeds to deliver parcels to a customer, and then is recovered by the truck at a third location. While the drone travels through a trip, the truck delivers parcels to other customers as long as the drone has enough battery to hover waiting for the truck. This work proposes a hybrid heuristic where the initial solution is created from the optimal TSP solution reached by a TSP solver. Next, an implementation of the general variable neighborhood search is employed to obtain the delivery routes of truck and drone. Computational experiments show the potential of the algorithm to improve significantly delivery time. Furthermore, we provide a new set of instances based on the well-known traveling salesman problem library instances. © 2019 The Authors.

The liner shipping problem is a multi-trip vehicle routing problem, and consists of deciding weekly routes for the selected ships. A solution method consisting of three phases is presented. In phase 1, all feasible single routes are generated for the largest ship available. Some of these routes will use only a small portion of the ship's capacity and can be performed by smaller ships at less cost. This fact is used when calculating the cost of each route. In phase 2, the single routes generated in phase 1 are combined into multiple routes. By solving a set partitioning problem (phase 3), where the columns are the routes generated in phases 1 and 2, we find both the optimal fleet and the coherent routes for the fleet. © 1999 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Fleet optimisation; Liner shipping; Multiple trips; Routing; Ships","","","","","","","","Ball M.O., Golden B., Assad A., Bodin L.D., Planning for truck fleet size in the presence of a common-carrier option, Decision Sciences, 14, 1, pp. 103-120, (1983); Bausch D.O., Brown G.G., Ronen D., Scheduling short-term marine transport of bulk products, Maritime Policy and Management, 25, 4, pp. 335-348, (1998); Bodin L.D., Golden B., Assad A., Ball M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: the state of the art, Computers and Operations Research, 10, 2, pp. 63-211, (1983); Brandao J., Mercer A., A tabu search algorithm for the multi-trip vehicle routing and scheduling problem, European Journal of Operational Research, 100, pp. 180-191, (1997); Brandao J., Mercer A., The multi-trip vehicle routing problem, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 49, pp. 799-805, (1998); Brown G.G., Graves G.W., Ronen D., Scheduling ocean transportation of crude oil, Management Science, 33, 3, pp. 335-346, (1987); Clarke G., Wright J., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points, Operations Research, 12, pp. 568-581, (1964); Dantzig G.B., Fulkerson D.R., Minimizing the number of tankers to meet a fixed schedule, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 1, pp. 217-222, (1954); Desaulniers G., Desrosiers J., Dumas Y., Solomon M.M., Soumis F., Daily aircraft routing and scheduling, Management Science, 43, 6, pp. 841-855, (1997); Desrochers M., Verhoog T.W., A new heuristic for the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem, Computers and Operations Research, 18, 3, pp. 263-274, (1991); Etezadi T., Beasley J.E., Vehicle fleet composition, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 34, pp. 87-91, (1983); Fagerholt K., A multi-trip ship routing problem, (1998); Fagerholt K., Christiansen M., Multi-product ship scheduling problem with flexible cargo holds: An optimisation based heuristic approach, (1998); Fisher M.L., Rosenwein M.B., An interactive optimization system for bulk-cargo ship scheduling, Naval Research Logistics, 36, pp. 27-42, (1989); Laporte G., Osman I.H., Routing problems: a bibliography, Annals of Operations Research, 61, pp. 227-262, (1995); Murotsu Y., Taguchi K., On optimum selection of ship fleet-size for investment purposes, Operational Research 1975, pp. 301-322, (1976); Taillard E.D., Laporte G., Gendreau M., Vehicle routing with multiple use of vehicles, Journal of the Operational Research Society, 47, pp. 1065-1070, (1996)","","","","","","","","","09696016","","","","English","Int.

More recently, however, with decreasing birth rates in nearly all of the developed countries and increasing average longevity globally, optimisation issues in Healthcare have become noticeably important and attract keen interest from the Operations Research community. Over the years, attention has gradually expanded from resource allocation and strategic planning to include operational issues such as resource scheduling and treatment planning. This paper surveys several applications of Operations Research in the domain of Healthcare. In particular, the paper reviews key contributions addressing contemporary optimisation issues in this area. It highlights current research activities, focusing on a variety of optimisation problems as well as solution techniques used for solving the optimisation problems. © 2010 The Authors.

One response has been to develop various “soft” methods (also called “problem structuring methods”) that focus on the human and political aspects of OR/MS interventions. Recent work, both theoretical and practitioner-based, involves the combination of several methods in a particular project (multimethod). Often the combination includes both hard (quantitative) and soft (qualitative) approaches. This paper illustrates the utility of soft methods, and in particular their combination, with recently published case studies. It then proposes an approach to the process of combining methods, including several frameworks and techniques to assist in selecting and linking different methods. Finally, it discusses future research in this field. © 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Critical management science; Critical systems thinking; Methodological pluralism; Methodology; Multimethodology;

It is a multi-start or iterative process, in which each GRASP iteration consists of two phases, a construction phase, in which a feasible solution is produced, and a local search phase, in which a local optimum in the neighborhood of the constructed solution is sought. Since 1989, numerous papers on the basic aspects of GRASP, as well as enhancements to the basic metaheuristic, have appeared in the literature. GRASP has been applied to a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems, ranging from scheduling and routing to drawing and turbine balancing. This is the second of two papers with an annotated bibliography of the GRASP literature from 1989 to 2008. In the companion paper, algorithmic aspects of GRASP are surveyed. In this paper, we cover the literature where GRASP is applied to scheduling, routing, logic, partitioning, location, graph theory, assignment, manufacturing, transportation, telecommunications, biology and related fields, automatic drawing, power systems, and VLSI design. © 2009 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","Applications; GRASP; Heuristics; Metaheuristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","09696016","","","","English","Int.

In a competitive market, costs reduction due to economies of scale in short and long run constitutes a key issue for small and medium enterprises. The paper reviews the existing literature on the topic and then examines different scenarios in order to quantify the savings in route costs that can be attained throughout horizontal cooperation. This numerical analysis is based on a set of well-known benchmarks for the Multidepot Vehicle Routing Problem, which has been adapted to illustrate a realistic but seldom considered example of horizontal cooperation. An Iterated Local Search algorithm is proposed to obtain high-quality solutions for this collaborative scenario, while noncollaborative scenarios are solved using a well-tested algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. The savings in routing costs-both regarding distance-based and environmental costs-are computed taking into account different geographical distributions of customers with respect to their assigned service providers. © 2015 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","Analysis of scenarios; Heuristics; Horizontal cooperation in transportation; Small and medium enterprises; Vehicle Routing Problem","Cost reduction; Economics; Geographical distribution; Greenhouse gases; Horizontal wells; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Analysis of scenarios; Heuristics; Horizontal cooperations; Small and medium enterprise; Vehicle Routing Problems; Gas emissions","","","","","","","Adenso-Diaz B., Garcia-Carbajal S., Lozano S., A GRASP algorithm for the routes conjoint planning in horizontal cooperation scenarios, Proceedings of the Eighth Spanish Meeting on Metaheuristics, pp. 561-566, (2012); Anand G., Bahinipati B.K., Measuring horizontal collaboration intensity in supply chain: a graph-theoretic approach, Production Planning & Control, 23, 10-11, pp. 801-816, (2012); Arshinder K., Kanda A., Deshmukh S.G., A review on supply chain coordination: coordination mechanisms, managing uncertainty and research directions, Supply Chain Coordination under Uncertainty, International Handbooks on Information Systems, pp. 39-82, (2011); Audy J.F., D'Amours S., Ronnqvist M., An empirical study on coalition formation and cost/savings allocation, International Journal of Production Economics, 136, 1, pp. 13-27, (2012); Audy J.F., D'Amours S., Rousseau L.-M., Cost allocation in the establishment of a collaborative transportation agreement.

In order to solve this kind of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem, this paper proposes an interactive MCDM approach based on an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multicriteria decision-making (TODIM) method and nonlinear programming (NLP) with intuitionistic linguistic numbers (ILNs). First, by comparing the existing operations and comparison methods for ILNs, new operations and a new comparison method are defined based on linguistic scale functions to obtain rational results. Second, considering their linguistic terms, membership degrees, and nonmembership degrees as a whole, the generalized distance between ILNs is defined with an adjustable parameter. Third, the total ranking of alternatives is obtained using the proposed NLP-based TODIM approach based on the generalized ILN distance. Finally, an example of selecting hotels from a tourism website is presented to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach. A comparison with existing methods is also conducted and analyzed. © 2016 The Authors.

In the last decade, new models of algorithms, new hardware for parallel execution/communication, and new challenges in solving complex problems have been making advances in a fast manner. We aim to discuss here on the state of the art, in a summarized manner, to provide a solution to deal with some of the growing topics. These topics include the utilization of classic parallel models in recent platforms (such as grid/cloud architectures and GPU/APU). However, porting existing algorithms to new hardware is not enough as a scientific goal, therefore researchers are looking for new parallel optimization and learning models that are targeted to these new architectures. Also, parallel metaheuristics, such as dynamic optimization and multiobjective problem resolution, have been applied to solve new problem domains in past years. In this article, we review these recent research areas in connection to parallel metaheuristics, as well as we identify future trends and possible open research lines for groups and PhD students. © 2012 International Federation of Operational Research Societies.","Analysis of algorithms; Communications; Metaheuristics; Parallel computing","Communication; Hardware; Heuristic algorithms; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Research; Parallel processing systems; Analysis of algorithms; Complex problems; Dynamic optimization; Future trends; Learning models; Meta heuristics; Multi-objective problem; Parallel executions; Parallel metaheuristics; Parallel models; Parallel optimization; Problem domain; State of the art; Analysis of algorithms; Meta heuristics; Parallel metaheuristics; Problem solving; Communication","","","","","","","Alba E., Parallel Metaheuristics: A New Class of Algorithms, (2005); Alba E., Almeida F., Blesa M., Cotta C., Diaz M., Dorta I., Gabarro J., Leon C., Luque G., Petit J., Rodriguez C., Rojas A., Xhafa F., Efficient parallel LAN/WAN algorithms for optimization.

We provide an extensive and comprehensive review of the existing literature on local governments' efficiency from a global point of view, covering all articles from 1990 to August 2016. This paper is the first of two. It covers the basic aspects related to local governments' efficiency measurement not taking into account the effect of environmental conditions. First, we show a detailed overview of the studies investigating public sector efficiency across various countries, comparing the data and samples employed, and the main results obtained. Second, we describe which techniques have been used for measuring efficiency in the context of local governments. Third, we summarize the inputs and outputs used. Finally, we discuss some operative directions and considerations for further research in the field. © 2017 The Authors.

We provide an extensive and comprehensive review of the existing literature on local governments' efficiency from a global point of view, covering all articles from 1990 to August 2016. This paper is the second of two. It covers the aspects related to local governments' efficiency measurement along with its determinants, that is, taking into account the effect of environmental variables over efficiency. First, we describe which techniques have been used to incorporate environmental variables in the context of local governments. Second, we provide a classification for the determinants used and summarize their impact on efficiency. Finally, we discuss some operative directions and considerations for further research in the field. © 2017 The Authors.
